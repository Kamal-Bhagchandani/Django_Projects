# Project 1: Social_Media (Insta Clone)

### Description
I developed this Django project as part of a 1-week Project-Based Learning (PBL) workshop at college, where I gained hands-on experience with Django.

### Features
- User registration and authentication (login/logout).
- Ability to create post by uploading image and writing caption and delete posts.

### Learning
- **Django ORM**: For working with databases and creating models.
- **Django Forms**: For creating user input forms such as registration and post submission.

This project helped me gain a basic overview of how to work with Django's powerful features, such as views, templates, models, and forms.
