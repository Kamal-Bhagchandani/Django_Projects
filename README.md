# Django Projects

Welcome to the **Django Projects** repository! This repository will contain all the projects and exercises that I work on as I learn and master the Django framework.

### Overview
In this repo, I will push everything I have learned in Django, starting from the basics and progressing to more advanced concepts. It will be a collection of projects that showcase the different aspects of Django development, from setting up a simple web application to creating fully functional web apps with advanced features.

## Projects List
1. **Project 1: Social_Media**
   -I developed this Django project as part of a 1-week Project-Based Learning (PBL) workshop at college, where I gained hands-on experience with Django and other Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and OpenCV, all under the guidance of skilled instructors.
